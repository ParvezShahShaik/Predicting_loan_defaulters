# Predicting Loan Defaulters

## Description
Data Analysis involves crafting a narrative using data for clear and effective communication, utilizing visualization methods like plots, charts, and tables. In the Finance domain, financial institutions face substantial losses due to vehicle loan defaults, necessitating a study to estimate determinants of vehicle loan default and create a predictive model. The dataset contains 41 attributes.

### Problem Statement
Financial institutions grapple with significant losses arising from vehicle loan defaults, demanding a study to estimate vehicle loan default determinants and construct a predictive model.

## Approach
### Data Preliminary Analysis
- Conduct preliminary data inspection, including structure, missing values, duplicates, etc.
- Adjust variable names to adhere to Python identifier naming conventions.
- Devise strategies to handle missing values while exploring the data.
- Provide statistical descriptions of quantitative data variables.
- Analyze the distribution of the target variable across various categories.

### Performing EDA and Modeling (Week 1 & Week 2)
#### Week 1:
- Explore employment types and their correlation with defaulters/non-defaulters using pie charts.
- Investigate age distribution concerning defaulters/non-defaulters.
- Examine ID proof types predominantly presented by customers.
- Explore factors impacting ratings (e.g., cuisines, cost, delivery options).

#### Week 2:
- Analyze credit bureau score distribution among defaulters vs. non-defaulters.
- Explore primary and secondary account details and their relationship with loan default probability.
- Investigate differences between sanctioned and disbursed loan amounts.
- Analyze whether customers with higher enquiry numbers are riskier.
- Study credit history's significance in estimating loan default probability.
- Perform logistic regression modeling, predict outcomes, and validate using a confusion matrix.

### Dashboarding
- Visualize data using Tableau for enhanced exploration.
- Create interactive dashboards showcasing variable relationships and influential factors.
